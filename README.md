To compile and run:

Pre-requisite:
0. Make sure Gradle is installed (https://gradle.org/install)
1. Use Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to run
the Android application. This also installs the Java SDK.

Server:
1. Navigate to 'Server' folder with terminal/PowerShell and type 'gradle run' to
compile and run the server on http://localhost:8080

Android:
0. (Since the server is run locally, it requires you to run the Android application
locally for it to work.)
1. Using the Android Studio, open the 'Arbtsprv' folder found inside 'Android',
run the application on an emulator.
